# XNAP - Hand written recognition
**Objective:** recognise "easy" hand written names.

**Type of model:** CNN, CNN + RNN, (transformer metric learning)

**Task:** text Recognition.

Hand written recogition is a classic problem in the field of pattern recognition and computer vision, it remains a significant challenge due to the variability and the complexity of different human handriting.

This project aims to leverage the power of deep learning to develop an accurate and efficient system for recognizing handwritten characters words or sentences by training neural networks on large datasets.
